This program, constructed through the genius of Tyler Collins and James Gelok, is a Tron Lightbike survival game. The goal is to move your colored bike around the arena without touching your (or your enemy's) trail left behind from the traveling bikes.

Through using techniques such as encircling your opponent, cutting him/her off, and many others you can force your enemy into your or her trail and obtain victory!
